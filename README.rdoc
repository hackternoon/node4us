== Welcome to node4.us

I use this software to help others, and myself, understand the features of node.js better.

Currently I'm using Rails to help serve it up.

Rails is a web-application framework that includes everything needed to create
database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Control pattern.

Eventually it might be pure node.js technology with no help from Rails.
